# Front Core API SDK

A simple, configurable SDK for interacting with [Front's Core API](https://dev.frontapp.com/reference/introduction). This package provides convenient wrappers for common API methods, including support for pagination, rate limiting, and typed inputs/outputs.

Use it in your app to call any of Front’s REST API endpoints with a clean, structured interface. More modules will be added over time.
